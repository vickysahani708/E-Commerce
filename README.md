✅ **Tip:**  
You can add screenshots of the **Admin Dashboard**, **Client App**, or **API Postman tests** under a `docs/screenshots` folder to make your README more professional.

If you want, I can also **write a shorter “GitHub-friendly” version** with badges, live demo links, and instructions so your repo looks polished and ready for recruiters.  

Do you want me to do that?
