          An e-commerce website is an online platform that allows businesses to sell products or 
          services over the internet. It provides customers with a convenient and secure way to 
          browse items, compare prices, place orders, and make payments from any device. A 
          well-designed e-commerce website typically features user-friendly navigation, detailed 
          product pages, shopping cart functionality, and multiple payment options. It may also 
          include customer reviews, personalized recommendations, order tracking, and customer 
          support tools. E-commerce websites help businesses reach a global audience, operate 24/7,
          and streamline sales through automated inventory management and integrated marketing features.
